# Knowledge-Backed Solo Leveling System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### 📚 Knowledge Engine Architecture

The system has been upgraded from a simple quest generator to a **knowledge-backed, real-world intelligence system** that grounds all quests, rewards, and strategies in authoritative sources.

## 🔒 CORE RULES IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ No Random Learning Logic
- All quests derive from real knowledge sources
- Every quest includes source attribution
- Principles come from authoritative books

### ✅ Knowledge → Quest Translation
- Principles converted to actionable quests
- Exercises derived from source materials
- Real-world application required

### ✅ Offline-First Intelligence
- All sources cached in IndexedDB
- Full functionality works offline
- Online sync available when connected

### ✅ System-Evaluated Rewards Only
- **NO manual reward claiming**
- Rewards only given after system analysis
- Report verification required
- Knowledge-backed quests have stricter verification

### ✅ Organic Quest Generation
- Background quest generator uses stored data
- Random timing (30min - 3 hours)
- Not every interaction generates a quest
- Feels natural and alive

## 📦 DATABASE UPDATES

### New Object Store: `knowledgeSources`
- Stores all knowledge sources for offline access
- Indexed by domain and author
- Version 2 database schema

**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 QUEST SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Knowledge-Backed Quest Generation
- AI Quest Generator now prioritizes knowledge-backed quests
- Background Quest Generator uses knowledge engine
- Fallback to regular generation if knowledge unavailable

### Source Attribution
- All knowledge-backed quests show source (hidden by default)
- Toggle button to reveal source information
- Displays: Source title, author, principle

**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🏆 REWARD SYSTEM

### System-Evaluated Only
- Rewards calculated automatically after report analysis
- No manual claiming buttons
- Knowledge-backed quests require:
  - Principle application detection
  - Real-world action taken
  - Outcome reported
  - Higher verification threshold (60+ score)

**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 📊 VERIFICATION

### Coverage Verification
Run `knowledgeVerification.verifyCoverage()` to check:
- All domains have 10+ sources
- Sources are properly structured
- Offline functionality works

### Quest Validation
Every quest is validated to ensure:
- Knowledge source exists
- Principle is included
- Exercise is actionable
- Source attribution is present

**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## 🚀 USAGE

### Automatic Quest Generation
The system automatically generates knowledge-backed quests from:
1. User activity data
2. Manual quest requests
3. Background analysis

### Manual Quest Request
User can describe an activity, and the system will:
1. Analyze the input
2. Match to knowledge domain
3. Generate quest from relevant source
4. Include source attribution

### Quest Completion
1. User submits report
2. System analyzes (knowledge-backed quests have stricter checks)
3. System verifies completion
4. **System automatically awards rewards** (no manual claiming)

## 📝 SOURCE ATTRIBUTION

All knowledge-backed quests include:
- Source ID
- Source Title
- Author
- Domain
- Principle applied
- Exercise/action required

**Display**: Hidden by default, toggle with "📚 Source" button
